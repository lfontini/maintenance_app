## Overview 

The Maintenance App is a user-friendly application designed to facilitate maintenance operations for clients. It allows users to easily create maintenance windows, cancel them if necessary, perform circuit tests, and manage services. Additionally, the app features a scheduler that conducts circuit tests before the maintenance window and automatically terminates services after the window ends.

## Features

### Maintenance Window Management:
- Create new maintenance windows.
- Cancel existing maintenance windows.
- Close maintenance windows after completion.
- Create Zabbix maintenance for the affected services.

### Circuit Testing:
- Test circuits before the maintenance window.
- Perform circuit tests after the maintenance window.
- Schedule validation tests (access the CPE and get the LAN traffic).
